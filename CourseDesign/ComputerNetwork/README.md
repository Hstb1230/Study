Computer Network
---
Include
1. VLAN - It divides the physical network to many different logic network.
2. Static routing and dynamic routing RIP
3. ACL - It limits the users in different network segment to connect other users.
4. Wi-Fi - Wireless Fidelity.
5. DHCP - It can assign the IP address to users dynamically.
6. NAT - A mapping technique. In this course design is to make users to use single IP address to connect the Internet.
7. DNS, HTTP Server - Application layer, the seventh layer in the OSI model.
8. IoT device - It simulates the application of some physical devices to the network.

Unfinished
1. VPN - The devices' function provided by the Cisio Packet Tracer is incomplete, and I don't further research these devices because the deadline is coming.
2. Manage Password - I didn't expect it at design time, but when I writing the readme, I thought it coule be done.

Deficiencies
1. Use too many expensive wires like fiber.
2. The devices in different IoT accounts can't communicate, but this is a problem of the simulator.
